Here's a DQL query for Dynatrace log ingestion with a filter for "failure":

```dql
fetch logs
| filter contains(content, "failure")
```

For more specific filtering options, you can use variations like:

**Case-insensitive search:**
```dql
fetch logs
| filter matchesPhrase(content, "failure")
```

**Filter by specific log level AND failure content:**
```dql
fetch logs
| filter loglevel == "ERROR" and contains(content, "failure")
```

**Filter with multiple failure-related terms:**
```dql
fetch logs
| filter contains(content, "failure") or contains(content, "failed") or contains(content, "error")
```

**Filter with time range:**
```dql
fetch logs, from: now() - 1h
| filter contains(content, "failure")
```

**Filter specific fields (if structured logs):**
```dql
fetch logs
| filter status == "failure" or contains(message, "failure")
```

**With additional fields displayed:**
```dql
fetch logs
| filter contains(content, "failure")
| fields timestamp, loglevel, content, dt.entity.service
```

The `content` field contains the full log message text. You can adjust these queries based on your specific log structure and which fields contain the "failure" information you're looking for.
