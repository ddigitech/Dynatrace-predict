# Dynatrace


The provided code implements a Python class, **`EnhancedDynatraceMetricsPredictor`**, designed to fetch, analyze, predict, and visualize metrics from a Dynatrace environment. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

---

## **Code Overview**

### **1. Imports**
The code uses several libraries for various purposes:
- **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib.pyplot`
- **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn` (for regression models and preprocessing)
- **Time Series Analysis**: `pmdarima` (for ARIMA modeling)
- **HTTP Requests**: `requests`
- **Logging**: `logging`
- **Environment Variables and Date Handling**: `os`, `datetime`, `timedelta`

---

### **2. Class Definition**
The class is named **`EnhancedDynatraceMetricsPredictor`**, and it encapsulates the following functionalities:

#### **Initialization (`__init__`)**
- Takes two parameters:
  - `dynatrace_url`: Base URL of the Dynatrace environment.
  - `api_token`: API token for authentication.
- Configures logging for debugging and error tracking.
- Sets HTTP headers for API requests.
- Initializes an empty list (`self.errors`) to track errors.

---

### **3. Methods**

#### **a. `fetch_metrics()`**
Fetches metric data from the Dynatrace API.

- **Inputs**:
  - `metric_key`: The specific metric to retrieve (e.g., request count).
  - `from_time`, `to_time`: Time range for the query.
- **Functionality**:
  - Sends a GET request to the Dynatrace API endpoint `/api/v2/metrics/query`.
  - Parses the JSON response into a Pandas DataFrame.
  - Logs success or errors during the process.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handles network issues (`requests.exceptions.RequestException`).
  - Validates response data and raises exceptions if no valid data is retrieved.

---

#### **b. `advanced_prediction()`**
Performs advanced predictions on the retrieved metrics using machine learning models.

- **Inputs**:
  - `metrics_df`: DataFrame containing metric data.
  - `target_column`: The column to predict (e.g., "value").
- **Functionality**:
  - Extracts features (`hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`) and target values from the DataFrame.
  - Splits data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
  - Scales features using `StandardScaler`.
  - Trains two models:
    1. Linear Regression
    2. Random Forest Regressor
  - Evaluates models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²).
  - Fits an ARIMA model for time-series forecasting.
- **Outputs**:
  - A dictionary containing model evaluation metrics and ARIMA forecasts.

---

#### **c. `visualize_predictions()`**
Visualizes historical data and predictions.

- **Inputs**:
  - `metrics_df`: Original DataFrame with historical data.
  - `predictions`: Dictionary of prediction results from `advanced_prediction()`.
  - `target_column`: The column being predicted.
- **Functionality**:
  - Plots historical data alongside predictions from different models.
  - Saves the visualization as an image file (`dynatrace_metrics_prediction.png`).

---

#### **d. `generate_comprehensive_report()`**
Generates a report summarizing model performance and errors encountered during execution.

- **Inputs**:
  - `predictions`: Dictionary of prediction results.
- **Outputs**:
  - A dictionary containing:
    - Model performance metrics (MSE, MAE, R²).
    - A list of logged errors.

---

### **4. Main Functionality**
The script includes a main function that demonstrates how to use the class:

1. Configures environment variables for Dynatrace URL and API token.
2. Instantiates the predictor class.
3. Fetches metrics for the past 30 days using a sample metric key (e.g., "builtin:service.requestCount.total").
4. Prepares additional features (`hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`) in the DataFrame.
5. Runs advanced predictions on the metric values.
6. Visualizes predictions as a time-series plot.
7. Generates a comprehensive report summarizing model performance.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **Error Handling & Logging**:
   Comprehensive logging tracks each step, making debugging easier.

2. **Multiple Prediction Models**:
   Combines traditional regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) with ARIMA for time-series forecasting.

3. **Visualization**:
   Creates clear visualizations of historical data and predictions for better interpretability.

4. **Modular Design**:
   Each method performs a specific task, making it reusable and easy to extend.

5. **Report Generation**:
   Summarizes model performance metrics and errors in an organized format.

---

## Example Workflow
1. Fetch metrics from Dynatrace using API credentials.
2. Train machine learning models on historical data to predict future trends.
3. Use ARIMA for time-series forecasting of hourly data over a week-long period.
4. Visualize results in a time-series plot showing both historical values and predictions.
5. Generate a report with evaluation metrics like MSE, MAE, and R² for all models used.

---

This code is ideal for organizations using Dynatrace who want to forecast key metrics like service request counts or response times based on historical trends while leveraging machine learning techniques in Python.
