# Dynatrace Security Research Groups (SRGs) - Detailed Explanation

## What are SRGs?

**Security Research Groups (SRGs)** in Dynatrace are predefined collections of security vulnerabilities grouped by common characteristics, attack vectors, or security standards. They help organizations prioritize and manage application security risks systematically.

## Key Components

### 1. **Purpose and Function**
- **Risk Aggregation**: Group related vulnerabilities to see the bigger security picture
- **Prioritization**: Focus remediation efforts on the most critical security issues
- **Compliance Mapping**: Align vulnerabilities with security frameworks (OWASP, CWE, etc.)
- **Trend Analysis**: Track security posture over time by vulnerability category

### 2. **Common SRG Categories**

**Injection Flaws**
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- LDAP Injection
- NoSQL Injection

**Authentication & Authorization**
- Broken authentication
- Session management issues
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities

**Sensitive Data Exposure**
- Unencrypted data transmission
- Inadequate cryptography
- Data leakage

**Security Misconfiguration**
- Default credentials
- Unnecessary services enabled
- Missing security patches

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM-based XSS

**Insecure Dependencies**
- Vulnerable third-party libraries
- Outdated components
- Known CVEs in dependencies

## How SRGs Work in Dynatrace

### Detection and Classification
1. **Runtime Application Protection**: Dynatrace monitors application behavior in real-time
2. **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies security issues through code-level visibility
3. **Automatic Grouping**: Assigns detected vulnerabilities to appropriate SRGs
4. **Severity Scoring**: Provides risk scores (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### Visualization and Reporting
- **Security Dashboard**: Shows SRG distribution across your environment
- **Trend Charts**: Visualizes vulnerability growth or reduction over time
- **Entity Relationships**: Links vulnerabilities to specific services, processes, and hosts
- **Attack Surface Mapping**: Shows which applications are most exposed

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. **Vulnerability Management Workflow**
```
Detection ? SRG Classification ? Risk Assessment ? Prioritization ? Remediation ? Validation
```

### 2. **Compliance Reporting**
- Map SRGs to compliance frameworks (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Generate reports showing security posture against standards
- Track remediation progress for audit purposes

### 3. **DevSecOps Integration**
- Alert development teams when new vulnerabilities appear in their services
- Block deployments with critical SRG violations
- Track security metrics in CI/CD pipelines

### 4. **Security Metrics**
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) security issues
- Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) by SRG category
- Vulnerability density per application
- Security debt tracking

## Working with SRGs

### Querying SRGs in DQL
```dql
fetch dt.security_problem
| filter security_problem_type == "INJECTION"
| summarize count(), by: {affected_entity, severity}
```

### Filtering by Risk Level
```dql
fetch dt.security_problem
| filter risk_score >= 7.0
| summarize problems = count(), by: {security_problem_type}
```

### Tracking Remediation
```dql
fetch dt.security_problem
| filter status == "RESOLVED"
| summarize resolved_count = count(), by: {security_problem_type, resolution_date}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Prioritization Strategy**
- Focus on Critical and High severity SRGs first
- Consider exploitability and business impact
- Address vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications first

### 2. **Regular Review Cycles**
- Weekly reviews of new vulnerabilities
- Monthly SRG trend analysis
- Quarterly security posture assessments

### 3. **Team Alignment**
- Assign SRG ownership to specific teams
- Establish SLAs for remediation by severity
- Create runbooks for common SRG types

### 4. **Integration Points**
- Connect to ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow)
- Feed data into SIEM platforms
- Integrate with vulnerability scanners

## Advanced Features

### Davis AI Integration
- **Automatic Root Cause Analysis**: Davis AI identifies why vulnerabilities exist
- **Impact Assessment**: Predicts blast radius of security issues
- **Smart Alerting**: Reduces noise by correlating related vulnerabilities

### Attack Detection
- Real-time monitoring of exploitation attempts
- Links detected attacks to specific SRG categories
- Provides attack chain visualization

### Third-Party Risk Management
- Identifies vulnerable dependencies
- Tracks supply chain security risks
- Monitors open-source component vulnerabilities

## Key Benefits

1. **Centralized Security Visibility**: Single pane of glass for application security
2. **Context-Aware Prioritization**: Understands runtime behavior and actual risk
3. **Automated Detection**: Continuous monitoring without manual scanning
4. **Faster Remediation**: Clear categorization speeds up fix implementation
5. **Compliance Alignment**: Maps to industry standards automatically

## Limitations to Consider

- Requires Dynatrace Application Security module
- Effectiveness depends on instrumentation coverage
- May require tuning to reduce false positives
- Focuses on runtime vulnerabilities (complements but doesn't replace SAST/DAST)

SRGs are a powerful feature for organizations looking to implement a data-driven, risk-based approach to application security management within their Dynatrace environment.
